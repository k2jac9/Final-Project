### Datasets Overview

PP Recipes Dataset Summary
File: PP_recipes.csv
Entries: 178,265
Columns:
id: Unique identifier for each recipe.
i: An additional identifier or index for recipes.
name_tokens: Encoded tokens representing the recipe's name.
ingredient_tokens: Encoded tokens representing the ingredients used in the recipe.
steps_tokens: Encoded tokens representing the cooking steps.
techniques: Encoded array indicating the cooking techniques used in the recipe.
calorie_level: A categorical representation indicating the calorie level of the recipe (0, 1, 2).
ingredient_ids: List of ingredient identifiers used in the recipe.
Info: This dataset contains detailed recipe information, including encoded representations of recipe names, ingredients, and cooking steps. It also provides data on the calorie level of each recipe and the specific ingredients used, identified by unique IDs.

Interactions Train Dataset
File: interactions_train.csv
Entries: 698,901
Columns:
user_id: Unique identifier for the user.
recipe_id: Unique identifier for the recipe.
date: The date of the interaction.
rating: The rating given by the user to the recipe.
u: A mapped user ID, potentially for easier reference.
i: A mapped recipe ID, potentially for easier reference.
Info: This dataset records user interactions with recipes, including ratings and the dates those ratings were given.

PP Users Dataset
File: PP_users.csv
Entries: 25,076
Columns:
u: User ID, which appears to correspond to user_id in the interactions dataset.
techniques: Encoded information about cooking techniques used by the user.
items: A list of item (recipe?) IDs interacted with by the user.
n_items: The number of items interacted with.
ratings: Ratings given by the user to items.
n_ratings: The number of ratings given, which matches n_items.
Info: This dataset seems to provide a summary of user activity, including the techniques they use, the recipes they've interacted with, and the ratings they've provided.

Ingredient Map
File: ingr_map.pkl
Keys: ['raw_ingr', 'raw_words', 'processed', 'len_proc', 'replaced', 'count', 'id']
Info: This pickle file appears to contain a mapping or dictionary related to ingredients, potentially offering a lookup from raw ingredient text to processed forms, along with some metadata about each ingredient (like count and a unique ID).
Summary & Observations
The interactions_train.csv dataset offers a detailed view of user interactions with recipes, which can be used for analyzing user preferences, recipe popularity, and potential rating predictions.
The PP_users.csv dataset aggregates user data, possibly to provide insights into user behavior, preferred cooking techniques, and overall engagement.
The ingr_map.pkl file could be key for interpreting ingredient data in recipes, allowing for analyses on ingredient popularity, usage patterns, and potential ingredient-based recipe recommendations.

Use Cases
Nutritional Analysis: Using the calorie_level and ingredient_ids, one can analyze the nutritional profiles of recipes.
Ingredient Trend Analysis: With ingredient_ids decoded using ingr_map.pkl, explore popular ingredients or ingredient combinations.
Recipe Recommendation: By integrating user interaction data, develop personalized recipe recommendation systems based on user preferences and behavior.
