Here's a breakdown of the main components and functionalities:

Config Class: This class holds configuration parameters and dataset paths. It allows for easy access and modification of these parameters without hardcoding them in the functions.

Setup Logging: The setup_logging function initializes the logging configuration, setting up both console and file handlers with specified formats and log levels.

Execution Time Decorator: The execution_time decorator measures the execution time of a function and logs the elapsed time.

Retry on Failure Decorator: The retry_on_failure decorator retries a function in case of specified exceptions, with exponential backoff.

Kaggle API Authentication: The kaggle_api_authenticate function authenticates the Kaggle API using credentials.

Download and Extract Kaggle Dataset: The download_and_extract_kaggle_dataset function downloads and extracts a specified Kaggle dataset if it's not already present in the destination path.

Download and Extract Kaggle Datasets in Parallel: The download_and_extract_kaggle_datasets function downloads and extracts multiple Kaggle datasets concurrently using parallel processing.

Find CSV Files: The find_csv_files function searches for CSV files within specified datasets and logs the total number found.

Main Function: The main function orchestrates the overall data setup process. It sets up logging, initiates dataset downloading and processing, and logs the completion of the dataset setup.

Performance Measurement Decorator: The timing_function decorator measures the execution time of a function and logs it.

Data Loading and Cleaning: Data loading and cleaning functions are defined to load datasets from specified paths, drop null values, and remove duplicates.

Data Visualization: Functions for visualizing data distributions, such as the distribution of recipe ratings, are defined.

Mean Centering Normalization: Functions to apply mean centering normalization to ratings data, preparing it for model training and evaluation, are provided.

Model Evaluation Function: The build_and_evaluate_recommendation_system function builds and evaluates a recommendation system using a specified algorithm, returning evaluation results.

Evaluation with KNN and SVD: The recommendation system is evaluated using the KNNBasic and SVD algorithms, with results for RMSE and MAE logged.

Building a Recipe Recommendation System: Functions to build and evaluate a recipe recommendation system are defined, utilizing the Surprise library for collaborative filtering.

Impact of Mean Centering: The impact of mean centering normalization on model performance is analyzed, with improvements in RMSE and MAE reported.

Optimized Model for Comparison: An optimized version of the recommendation system is implemented, with improved performance using mean centering normalization.

Overall, the code demonstrates a comprehensive approach to setting up a recommendation system, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on robustness, efficiency, and performance optimization.
